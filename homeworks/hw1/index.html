    Hello, My name is Sean Lin,林祐增. I'm from Taiwan. I graduated from National Taiwan University with a DVM degree, and now I'm studying infectious diseases in the School of Public Health. I'm a hydrophilic person, which means that I swim, I surf, and I scuba. Besides, I like performances, both as an audience and as a performer.
