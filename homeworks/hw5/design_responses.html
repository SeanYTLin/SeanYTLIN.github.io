                            <p>The design of the website animation is very attractive. It can improve the user experience if the website is well-designed. Designers should think about how the animation work(e.g. the direction of the animation.)

                            <p>All the examples are great and inspiring. For example, the speed of the animation, the direction of the animation, and how the zoom in and zoom out. These elements should be considered for web design.

                            <p> Shopping App Transitions by Vlad Fedoseyev for Norde. I like how the product is introduced when you click the item. The website shows part of the information/image step by step, which can help the user to digest the information. Afterward, the animation becomes very simple, not too fancy. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p>8/10. I know sometimes it is better to learn from our own feeling, but if the article can provide some hints where the reader can learn from the examples will be great. </p>
